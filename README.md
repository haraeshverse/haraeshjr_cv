# Haraesh JAYASETHU RAMACHANDRAN
## Introduction
Hello! My name is Haraesh (pronounced h-array-sh). You've probably come here through my CV, through my LinkedIn or randomly stumbled upon it online. (I am so sorry if you belong to the last category)

I'm currently pursuing a Masters in Cloud and Network Infrastructures at the University of Rennes, and I live in Rennes, France. I'm from South India, and before I came to France, I worked as a software developer for 4 years in .NET/C#.

This is intended to be, for better or for worse, my online resume/CV. I usually don't give this much information about my profile in my paper/PDF version of my CV since it's a challenge to fit all of it in one page, but I always think a "resume/CV" as it were is supposed to be comprehensive, providing a complete overview of one's profile; and hence I thought this comprehensive profile could be online on a Github Pages repository.
